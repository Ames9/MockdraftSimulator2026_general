Pick
1
Las Vegas Raiders
Las Vegas Raiders
3-14
Strength of schedule: .538
Biggest needs: QB, LG, LB, DT, C, RT, WR, CB

While there’s a long way to go between now and draft day, it certainly feels like a fait accompli that the Raiders will pick a quarterback in the first round for the first time since 2007.
Pick
2

New York Jets
New York Jets
3-14
Strength of schedule: .552
Biggest needs: QB, OG, DT, EDGE, CB

The Jets tore things down to the studs at the trade deadline and now have a pile of draft assets to help them reset, including four of the top 50 picks.
Pick
3

Arizona Cardinals
Arizona Cardinals
3-14
Strength of schedule: .571
Biggest needs: QB, OT, S, RB, Edge, FS, LB

It looks messy in Arizona after the team’s collapse following a 2-0 start to the season. The first priority has to be charting a path forward at the quarterback position with the Cardinals likely to move on from Kyler Murray, per NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo.
Pick
4

Tennessee Titans
Tennessee Titans
3-14
Strength of schedule: .574
Biggest needs: WR, Edge, CB, OG

GM Mike Borgonzi has his work cut out for him. In addition to strengthening Cam Ward’s supporting cast on offense -- a must to set a foundation for the 2025 No. 1 overall pick -- he’ll need to tighten up one of the league’s worst defenses.
Pick
5

New York Giants
New York Giants
4-13
Strength of schedule: .524
Biggest needs: OT, RG, WR, CB, LB, DT

Netting the first pick could have led to a franchise-altering windfall for the Giants, but back-to-back wins to close the season dropped them four spots in the order. The organization can focus on building around a promising young passer in Jaxson Dart.
Pick
6

Cleveland Browns
Cleveland Browns
5-12
Strength of schedule: .486
Biggest needs: QB, OT, OG, C, CB, WR, LB

With Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel ranking last and second-to-last in EPA per dropback (min. 200 dropbacks), the Browns’ search for an answer at quarterback continues.
Pick
7

Washington Commanders
Washington Commanders
5-12
Strength of schedule: .507
Biggest needs: Edge, WR, LB, CB, OG, OG

Things fell apart in an injury-plagued year for Jayden Daniels, and now GM Adam Peters has to pick up the pieces. Giving Daniels more help will be essential, but Dan Quinn will need to fix a defense that hasn’t finished in the top half of the league in scoring on his watch.
Pick
8

New Orleans Saints
New Orleans Saints
6-11
Strength of schedule: .495
Biggest needs: LG, DT, Edge, WR, LB, RB, CB

There are plenty of needs on both sides of the ball, from surrounding Tyler Shough with more playmakers to adding juice on the defensive line.
Pick
9

Kansas City Chiefs
Kansas City Chiefs
6-11
Strength of schedule: .514
Biggest needs: CB, FS, RB, Edge, WR

The Chiefs, holding a top-10 pick for the first time since they traded up to draft Patrick Mahomes, have some major question marks to address, including Travis Kelce’s future. It certainly sounds like they want him back, though.
Pick
10

Cincinnati Bengals
Cincinnati Bengals
6-11
Strength of schedule: .521
Biggest needs: DT, FS, OG, CB, LB, Edge

Cincinnati is holding its highest pick since drafting Ja’Marr Chase fifth overall in 2021. Will the Bengals use it to shore up the Joe Burrow-led offense or fill a hole in a defense that sank in 2025?
Pick
11

Miami Dolphins
Miami Dolphins
7-10
Strength of schedule: .488
Biggest needs: QB, WR, CB, CB, Edge, OG

It seems the Dolphins are ready for a fresh start at quarterback after benching Tua Tagovailoa. Offensive line investments will be essential for whoever is under center next season.
Pick
12

Dallas Cowboys
Dallas Cowboys
7-9-1
Strength of schedule: .438
Biggest needs: CB, WR, Edge, RB, LB, S

With two first-round picks in 2026, the Cowboys have a chance to rebuild a defense that resides at the bottom of the league.
Pick
13

Los Angeles Rams
Los Angeles Rams
PICK ACQUIRED FROM THE ATLANTA FALCONS

Falcons' record: 8-9
Strength of schedule: .495

Rams' biggest needs: CB, S, WR, OT, C

Quentin Lake signed an extension before the end of the season, but the secondary will still require significant attention with Kam Kam Curl, Cobie Durant and Roger McCreary headed for free agency.

See the bottom of this article for analysis of the Falcons' needs.
Pick
14

Baltimore Ravens
Baltimore Ravens
8-9
Strength of schedule: .507
Biggest needs: DT, C, Edge, S, WR, TE, CB
After a crushing end to the 2025 campaign, GM Eric DeCosta has to find a way to crank up the Ravens’ pass rush. They finished the season with the fourth-lowest QB pressure rate and third-fewest sacks in the league.
Pick
15

Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
8-9
Strength of schedule: .529
Biggest needs: Edge, DT, TE, LB, WR, CB

For the first time since the 2019 season, the Buccaneers missed the playoffs. Now they’re faced with the impending free agencies of some core contributors, including Lavonte David.

Colts' record: 8-9
Strength of schedule: .540

See the bottom of this article for analysis of the Colts' needs.
Pick
17

Detroit Lions
Detroit Lions
9-8
Strength of schedule: .490
Biggest needs: Edge, DT, LB, CB, OT, C, OG

Former strengths turned into weaknesses for the Lions in 2025. GM Brad Holmes has work to do in the trenches, including finding an edge-rushing complement for Aidan Hutchinson.
Pick
18

Minnesota Vikings
Minnesota Vikings
9-8
Strength of schedule: .514
Biggest needs: S, CB, WR, LB, QB

The Vikings were tremendous on defense, especially down the stretch, but the team’s most pressing needs are on that side of the ball heading into the offseason. Harrison Smith could be headed for retirement.
Pick
19

Carolina Panthers
Carolina Panthers
8-9
Strength of schedule: .522
Biggest needs: C, LB, S, CB, DT, Edge

The center position and overall depth up front are the first areas Carolina should be looking to upgrade on offense. Free agency threatens to leave holes at all three levels of the defense, too.
Pick
20
Dallas Cowboys
Dallas Cowboys
PICK ACQUIRED FROM THE GREEN BAY PACKERS

Packers' record: 9-7-1
Strength of schedule: .483

See the bottom of this article for analysis of the Packers' needs.
Pick

10-7
Strength of schedule: .503
Biggest needs: QB, WR, CB, S, OG, DT

Pick
22

Los Angeles Chargers
Los Angeles Chargers
11-6
Strength of schedule: .469
Biggest needs: OG, OG, C, Edge, DT, S

Reinforcements are needed in the trenches -- on both sides of the ball -- for a squad that prides itself on winning at the line of scrimmage.
Pick
23

Philadelphia Eagles
Philadelphia Eagles
11-6
Strength of schedule: .476
Biggest needs: OG, CB, TE, RT, OG, S

What does GM Howie Roseman have up his sleeve this offseason? He’ll have tough decisions to make with Dallas Goedert, Jaelan Phillips and Reed Blankenship among the Eagles’ impending free agents.
Pick

Pick
25

Chicago Bears
Chicago Bears
11-6
Strength of schedule: .458

Pick
26
Buffalo Bills
Buffalo Bills
12-5
Strength of schedule: .471
Biggest needs: Edge, OG, C, WR, DT, CB, LB

If the Bills are going to maximize Josh Allen’s abilities, surrounding him with a better group of wide receivers has to be a priority for the franchise.
Pick
27

San Francisco 49ers
San Francisco 49ers
12-5
Strength of schedule: .498
Biggest needs: WR, OG, DT, C, CB

Jauan Jennings and Kendrick Bourne played leading roles at wide receiver in 2025, but both are ticketed for free agency. With a split from Brandon Aiyuk looming, as well, a team that understands the importance of depth at the position might have to retool.
Pick
28

Houston Texans
Houston Texans
12-5
Strength of schedule: .522
Biggest needs: OG, DT, RB, S, OT, C

Once again, the Texans are in the market for offensive line help. They had one of the league’s worst O-lines in 2025, and starting guard Ed Ingram is headed for free agency.
Pick

12-5
Strength of schedule: .526

See Pick No. 13 for analysis of the Rams' needs.
Pick
30
Denver Broncos
Denver Broncos
14-3
Strength of schedule: .422
Biggest needs: DT, LB, TE, RB, WR

Denver could have some significant production to replace at linebacker in 2026. Two of their top five leading tacklers -- Alex Singleton and Justin Strnad -- are scheduled to hit the open market.
Pick
31

New England Patriots
New England Patriots
14-3
Strength of schedule: .391
Biggest needs: Edge, S, OT, C, TE, DT

New England had a top-five scoring defense in 2025, but the team could still use a stud edge rusher to play opposite Harold Landry. K'Lavon Chaisson’s deal expires in March.
